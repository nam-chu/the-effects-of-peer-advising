Q: What should I choose to be in the control group?
   - The control group in the data has 1006 students.
   - The treatment group has 113 students.
   - Could possibly use the students who signed up for the SSP group but didn't actually attend the SSPs.
Q: The grades in high school and the grades in first year and second year are on different GPA scales. How should should I standardize it?
