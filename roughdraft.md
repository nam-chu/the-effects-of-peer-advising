## Data Description

- survey data which was randomly administered in the fall of 2025 at a large commuter school in Canada. Although the author doesn't explicitly mention it, the school was ascertained to be the University of Toronto Missisauga due to a variable name.
- Students who were selected for the study were below the first quartile in terms of entering hs gpa. This was because students who place in the upper quartile are more likely to graduate than those who don't.

  1) Service Strategy: Student Support Program (SSP)
  2) Incentive Stategy: Student Fellowship Program (SFP)
  3) Both: SFSP (Student Fellowship and Student Program)
- students in the treatment group were randomly assigned and asked to sign-up for one of the three services. They were presumably not told beforehand which one.
